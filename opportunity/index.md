Are you fascinated by the intricately interconnected networks of life?
Are you concerned about ongoing biodiversity loss (especially among the small creatures!) and driven to study the future of the vital functions they provide?
Do you want to conduct cross-boundary ecological research that integrate various biological levels, from gene to community, to understand how biological systems respond to disturbance?  

We warmly welcome prospective students at all levels (undergraduates, Master's and PhD) to contact me for opportunities about graduate studies (Master and PhD) and visiting studentship. Please send me your CV and a brief personal statement (outlining your research interests, motivations, and relevant background). We are also actively recruiting a lab manager and postdocsâ€”please contact me for details (jlchen(AT)nju.edu.cn). 

Your sincerely,

Jinlin Chen (she/her)
