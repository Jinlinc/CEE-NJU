# About

Climate change is drastically reshaping species distributions and populations, with cascading ecological impacts already disrupting human societies—and intensifying. Community responses are often not gradual, their nonlinear nature challenge traditional methods to predict the vulnerability and sensitivity of biodiversity to climate change. Our research group focuses on the empirical research conducted in the field and lab, in combination with molecular techniques and mathematical modelling. Using invertebrate systems (especially fruit fly – parasitoid communities), we investigate (1) the eco-evolutionary dynamics of biological communities driven by extreme climatic events, (2) mechanisms regulating coexistence and numerical dynamics within species interaction networks, (3) insect distribution and their ecological functions under global changes.

## Research Topics

{% capture text %}

Extreme events open up a transient stage where evolutionary and ecological processes happen at a fast pace, interacting with each other to decide how the post-extreme communities will rewire. I am using manipulative experiments (semi-field) to explore if and how extreme temperature events will increase/decrease the resilience of biological communities to increasingly variable climates in the future.
