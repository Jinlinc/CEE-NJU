The CEE group is delighted to welcome two enthusiastic new students. To celebrate our team suddenly tripling in size, Jie, WeiMing, Chen, and Jinlin went out for a barbecue. We had a great time exchanging MBTI types etc. The food was so tasty that we forgot to take a group photo! We'll be sure to get one at our next gathering in December.
