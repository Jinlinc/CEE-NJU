Ge spent all her summer in the lab and Nanjing University Xianlin Campus to invent a easy and standardized way to evaluate the strength of species interactions (competition, parasitism and predation) and used it to understand the not-subtle difference that micro-climate had on species interactions. We will miss you, Ge, and we wish one day you will come back to our lab to further pursue your research interests!
