Chen is currently conducting the undergraduate research project at CEE lab and will begin his Master degree study in Autumn 2026.

His research interests focus on the climate sensitivity of species interactions under global climate change. To address these questions, he intends to integrate multiple approaches, including controlled laboratory experiments, ecological modeling, as well as big data analysis. His work aims to contribute to a deeper and finer understanding of how communities and ecosystems will respond to future climate change.
