I am currently conducting undergraduate research project at CEE lab and will begin my Master degree study in Autumn 2026.

My research interests focus on the climate sensitivity of species interactions under global climate change. To address these questions, I integrate multiple approaches, including controlled laboratory experiments, ecological modeling, as well as big data analysis. I hope that my work will lead to a deeper and finer understanding of  how communities and ecosystems will respond to future climate change.
