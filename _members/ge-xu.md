I conducted a two-month research project at CEE lab during the hot and humid summer of 2025 in Nanjing. I invented an easy and standardized way to evaluate the strength of species interactions (competition, parasitism and predation) and used it to understand the not-subtle difference that micro-climate had on species interactions.

I am about to join East China Normal University to further pursue a Master's degree in Ecology. Having a huge interest in community ecology, I'm going to study the change of phylogenetic diversity of plants over community succession. Plus, I'm also keen on the species interaction and biological invasion under global climate change.
