I am a community ecologist who is also passionate about nature conservation, sustainability, and environmental justice. I am interested in studying population dynamics, species interactions and the impact of anthropogenic activities on ecological processes and functioning.

I love backcountry hiking and many kinds of sports. Volleyball and Table Tennis are what I have been doing the longest and msot frequent. I am also keen to learn new sports, such as climbing, surfing and surf skates!
