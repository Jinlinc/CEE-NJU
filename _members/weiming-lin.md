I am a research assistant in CEE Lab, with broad interests in species interactions and coexistence, community dynamics, biodiversity–ecosystem  functioning, and biodiversity conservation. During my Master’s research at Fudan University, I combined field surveys with statistical modelling to study the ecology and conservation of the large Indian civet (<i>Viverra zibetha</i>). I am currently collecting life history data of fruit flies and their parasitoid originated from Nanjing, deploying molecular methods to study food webs and ALSO initiating research on community dynamics and rapid evolution under climate change.
